# Installing Quick

> **If you're using Xcode 7.1,** use the latest version of Quick--`v0.9.0` at the time of writing.
> New releases are developed on the `swift-2.0` branch.



Quick provides the syntax to define examples and example groups. Nimble
provides the `expect(...).to` assertion syntax. You may use either one,
or both, in your tests.

There are three recommended ways of linking Quick to your tests:

1. [Git Submodules](#git-submodules)
2. [CocoaPods](#cocoapods)
3. [Carthage](#carthage)
4. [Swift Package Manager (experimental)](#swift-package-manager)

Choose one and follow the instructions below. Once you've completed them,
you should be able to `import Quick` from within files in your test target.

## Git Submodules

To link Quick and Nimble using Git submodules:

1. Add submodule for Quick.
2. If you don't already have a `.xcworkspace` for your project, create one. ([Here's how](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/recipes/xcode_help-structure_navigator/articles/Adding_an_Existing_Project_to_a_Workspace.html))
3. Add `Quick.xcodeproj` to your project's `.xcworkspace`.
4. Add `Nimble.xcodeproj` to your project's `.xcworkspace`. It exists in `path/to/Quick/Externals/Nimble`. By adding Nimble from Quick's dependencies (as opposed to adding directly as a submodule), you'll ensure that you're using the correct version of Nimble for whatever version of Quick you're using.
5. Link `Quick.framework` and `Nimble.framework` in your test target's
   "Link Binary with Libraries" build phase.

First, if you don't already have one, create a directory for your Git submodules.
Let's assume you have a directory named `Vendor`.

**Step One:** Download Quick and Nimble as Git submodules:

```sh
git submodule add git@github.com:Quick/Quick.git Vendor/Quick
git submodule add git@github.com:Quick/Nimble.git Vendor/Nimble
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

**Step Two:** Add the `Quick.xcodeproj` and `Nimble.xcodeproj` files downloaded above to
your project's `.xcworkspace`. For example, this is `Guanaco.xcworkspace`, the
workspace for a project that is tested using Quick and Nimble:

**Step Three:** Link the `Quick.framework` during your test target's
`Link Binary with Libraries` build phase. You should see two
`Quick.frameworks`; one is for macOS, and the other is for iOS.

Do the same for the `Nimble.framework`, and you're done!

**Updating the Submodules:** If you ever want to update the Quick
or Nimble submodules to latest version, enter the Quick directory
and pull from the master repository:

```sh
cd /path/to/your/project/Vendor/Quick
git checkout master
git pull --rebase origin master
```

Your Git repository will track changes to submodules. You'll want to
commit the fact that you've updated the Quick submodule:

```sh
cd /path/to/your/project
git commit -m "Updated Quick submodule"
```

**Cloning a Repository that Includes a Quick Submodule:** After other people
clone your repository, they'll have to pull down the submodules as well.
They can do so by running the `git submodule update` command:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

You can read more about Git submodules [here](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules).

## CocoaPods

First, update CocoaPods to Version 0.36.0 or newer, which is necessary to install CocoaPods using Swift.

Then, add Quick and Nimble to your Podfile. Additionally, the ```use_frameworks!``` line is necessary for using Swift in CocoaPods:

```rb

# Podfile

use_frameworks!

def testing_pods
    pod 'Quick'
    pod 'Nimble'
end

target 'MyTests' do
    testing_pods
end

target 'MyUITests' do
    testing_pods
end
```

Finally, download and link Quick and Nimble to your tests:

```sh
pod install
```

### Using Swift 1.2?

The latest release of Quick (0.4.0) is for Swift 2 (Xcode 7), but the latest Nimble (1.0.0) is for Swift 1.2 (Xcode 6).

If you want Xcode 6 do:

```sh
target 'MyTests' do
  use_frameworks!
  pod 'Quick', '~>0.3.0'
  pod 'Nimble', '~>1.0.0'
end
```

## [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

As test targets do not have the "Embedded Binaries" section, the frameworks must
be added to the target's "Link Binary With Libraries" as well as a "Copy Files" build phase
to copy them to the target's Frameworks destination.

 > As Carthage builds dynamic frameworks, you will need a valid code signing identity set up.

1. Add Quick to your [`Cartfile.private`](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/Documentation/Artifacts.md#cartfileprivate):

    ```
    github "Quick/Quick"
    github "Quick/Nimble"
    ```

2. Run `carthage update`.
3. From your `Carthage/Build/[platform]/` directory, add both Quick and Nimble to your test target's "Link Binary With Libraries" build phase:

4. For your test target, create a new build phase of type "Copy Files":

5. Set the "Destination" to "Frameworks", then add both frameworks:

This is not "the one and only way" to use Carthage to manage dependencies.
For further reference check out the [Carthage documentation](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/README.md).

## [Swift Package Manager](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager)
With the advent of the [swift.org](https://swift.org) open-source project, Swift now has an official, though nascent, package manager tool. Notably, this provides the possibility of using Quick on non-Apple platforms for the first time. Initial steps have been taken to allow using Quick to test projects using the Swift Package Manager, although frequent breakage is expected at this point since the tool is still under heavy development.

Until further documentation has been written, the following repository may be useful as an example of how Quick can be declared as a dependency in a `Package.swift` file for SwiftPM:

### (Not Recommended) Running Quick Specs on a Physical iOS Device

In order to run specs written in Quick on device, you need to add `Quick.framework` and
`Nimble.framework` as `Embedded Binaries` to the `Host Application` of the
test target. After adding a framework as an embedded binary, Xcode will
automatically link the host app against the framework.

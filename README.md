Quick is a behavior-driven development framework for Swift and Objective-C.
Inspired by [RSpec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec), [Specta](https://github.com/specta/specta), and [Ginkgo](https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo).

```swift
// Swift

import Quick
import Nimble

class TableOfContentsSpec: QuickSpec {
  override func spec() {
    describe("the 'Documentation' directory") {
      it("has everything you need to get started") {
        let sections = Directory("Documentation").sections
        expect(sections).to(contain("Organized Tests with Quick Examples and Example Groups"))
        expect(sections).to(contain("Installing Quick"))
      }

      context("if it doesn't have what you're looking for") {
        it("needs to be updated") {
          let you = You(awesome: true)
          expect{you.submittedAnIssue}.toEventually(beTruthy())
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
#### Nimble
Quick comes together with [Nimble](https://github.com/Quick/Nimble) — a matcher framework for your tests. You can learn why `XCTAssert()` statements make your expectations unclear and how to fix that using Nimble assertions [here](./Documentation/en-us/NimbleAssertions.md).

## Documentation

All documentation can be found in the [Documentation folder](./Documentation), including [detailed installation instructions](./Documentation/en-us/InstallingQuick.md) for CocoaPods, Carthage, Git submodules, and more. For example, you can install Quick and [Nimble](https://github.com/Quick/Nimble) using CocoaPods by adding the following to your Podfile:

```rb
# Podfile

use_frameworks!

def testing_pods
    pod 'Quick'
    pod 'Nimble'
end

target 'MyTests' do
    testing_pods
end

target 'MyUITests' do
    testing_pods
end
```

## Projects using Quick

Many apps use both Quick and Nimble however, as they are not included in the app binary, neither appear in “Top Used Libraries” blog posts. Therefore, it would be greatly appreciated to remind contributors that their efforts are valued by compiling a list of organizations and projects that use them. 

Does your organization or project use Quick and Nimble? If yes, [please add your project to the list](https://github.com/Quick/Quick/wiki/Projects-using-Quick).

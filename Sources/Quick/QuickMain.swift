/// When using Quick with swift-corelibs-xctest, automatic discovery of specs and
/// configurations is not available. Instead, you should create a standalone
/// executable and call this function from its main.swift file. This will execute
/// the specs and then terminate the process with an exit code of 0 if the tests
/// passed, or 1 if there were any failures.
///
/// Quick is known to work with the DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-2016-02-08-a Swift toolchain.
///
/// - parameter specs: An array of QuickSpec subclasses to run
/// - parameter configurations: An array QuickConfiguration subclasses for setting up
//                              global suite configuration (optional)
/// - parameter testCases: An array of XCTestCase test cases, just as would be passed
///                        info `XCTMain` if you were using swift-corelibs-xctest directly.
///                        This allows for mixing Quick specs and XCTestCase tests in one run.

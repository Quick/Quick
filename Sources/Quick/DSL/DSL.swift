/**
    Defines a closure to that wraps each example in the current example

    The closure you pass to aroundEach receives a callback as its argument, which
    it MUST call exactly one for the example to run properly:

        aroundEach { runExample in
            doSomeSetup()
            runExample()
            doSomeCleanup()

    This callback is particularly useful for test decartions that canâ€™t split
    into a separate beforeEach and afterEach. For example, running each example
    in its own autorelease pool requires aroundEach:

        aroundEach { runExample in
            autoreleasepool {
                runExample()
            }
            checkObjectsNoLongerRetained()
        }

    You can also use aroundEach to guarantee proper nesting of setup and cleanup
    operations in situations where their relative order matters.

    An example group may contain an unlimited number of aroundEach callbacks.
    They will nest inside each other, with the first declared in the group
    nested at the outermost level.

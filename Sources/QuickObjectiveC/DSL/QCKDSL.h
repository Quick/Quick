/**
    Defines a closure to that wraps each example in the current example
    group. This closure is not run for pending or otherwise disabled examples.

    The closure you pass to aroundEach receives a callback as its argument, which
    it MUST call exactly one for the example to run properly:

        aroundEach(^(QCKDSLEmptyBlock runExample) {
            [self doSomeSetup];
            runExample();
            [self doSomeCleanup];
        });

    This callback is particularly useful for test decartions that canâ€™t split
    into a separate beforeEach and afterEach. For example, running each example
    in its own autorelease pool requires aroundEach:

        aroundEach(^(QCKDSLEmptyBlock runExample) {
            @autoreleasepool {
                runExample();
            }
            [self checkObjectsNoLongerRetained];
        });

    You can also use aroundEach to guarantee proper nesting of setup and cleanup
    operations in situations where their relative order matters.

    An example group may contain an unlimited number of aroundEach callbacks.
    They will nest inside each other, with the first declared in the group
    nested at the outermost level.

    - parameter closure: The closure that wraps around each example.
